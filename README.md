# Fahle.dev

This is my personal portfolio website. It is a remake of a windows 98 desktop.

## Features

- List my github repositories (this one included!)
- Show some text about me
- display some cherry-picked projects with more detail
- play minesweeper??!?!

Oh and most of the features don't even exist yet. So for now, you can check out my Github repositories on it.
